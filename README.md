# Countries-as-Agents-in-a-Global-Scale-Computational-Model
This research paper this repository supports describes a simulation model.  This repository provides the needed code and data used to generate results.

The ramifications of formal defense agreements between countries are examined using an agent-based model.  Our agent-based model builds on previous work and creates an empirically based version of a tribute model in which actors within existing real-world networks demand tribute  from one another.  If the threatened actor does not pay the tribute, the aggressing actor will engage in a decision to start a war.  Tribute and war payments are based on a measure of the countryâ€™s wealth. We utilize the Correlates of War dataset to provide us with worldwide historical defense alliance information.  Using these networks as our initial conditions, we run the model forward from four prominent historical years and simulate the interactions that take place as well as the changes in overall wealth.  Agents in the model employ a cost benefit analysis in their decision of whether or not to go to war.  This model provides results that are in qualitative agreements with historical emergent macro outcomes seen over time.
